# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
The goal of this project is to predict the sentiment of the tweet in 2 categories, positive or negative.
In this project, i have used various NLP techniques(lemmatizer, word_tokenize,e.t.c) to clean the data. For prediction, i have build a deep learning model, which gives decent accuracy of 0.99 on test data.
